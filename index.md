I am a criminal justice major and computer science minor at CSUF. I plan on graduating in 2026.

## favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, part 2, was one of my favorites because it was enjoyable to help develop a guessing game. We had to design a program with if statements that determine potential outputs based on the number guessed. We used std::cout to generate outputs if guesses were correct, too high, too low, or incorrect. 

Lab 6, part 1, was a fun lab because we got to customize a program that would follow a pattern to read the components of a sandwich from command-line arguments. The program had to be formatted correctly to validate that the number of command-line arguments is correct. It was exciting to see the order and message the computer generated describing an order for our sandwich as an output.

Lab 8, part 1, was one of my favorites because I watch a lot of shows, including the Olympics, that consist of judge ratings. I never thought deeply about how they get average scores to determine the best and least scored. In this lab, we calculated the judge's average by using all scores/elements except the minimum and the maximum. We computed the sum of all the elements, the maximum, the minimum, eliminated the maximum and the minimum from the sum, then computed the average mean by dividing the sum to the number of elements minus 2. This was an interesting but surprisingly fair way to calculate the Olympic average scores.
